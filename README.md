# swbf2bugs
A demo repository to try and pull together all swbf2 bugs
------
This is designed to be a demo repository. Ideally this would be run by DICE, however, if it becomes useful, we can as a community can use this to understand what is out there. 

### How to report a bug
-----
1. Please go to the issues tab and run a search for open and closed bugs!
2. If the bug exists, please feel free to add to an issue to provide supporting information
3. If a bug is marked by a dev as "Not a bug" and closed, don't reopen it. Your issue will just be closed and linked to the original explaination
4. If you don't see your bug in open or closed bugs, please open an issue. There is a default bug template, when you create an issue. It helps to ensure all the information is collected.  

I am happy to change the template to add more information if desired.
