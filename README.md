# swbf2bugs
A demo repository to try and pull together all swbf2 bugs
------
This is designed to be a demo repository. Ideally this would be run by DICE or at least Co-run, however, if it becomes useful, we can as a community can use this to understand what is out there even if DICE does not want to comment or participate. (They are welcome to lurk and use this as well...)


### How to report a bug
-----
1. Please go to the issues tab and run a search for open and closed bugs!
2. If the bug exists, please feel free to add to an issue to provide supporting information
3. If a bug is marked by a dev as "Not a bug" and closed, don't reopen it. Your issue will just be closed and linked to the original explaination
4. If you don't see your bug in open or closed bugs, please open an issue. There is a default bug template, when you create an issue. It helps to ensure all the information is collected.  

I am happy to change the template to add more information if desired. 

### Bug management
-----
This repo is not related to SWBF2 or Dice, or EA or anything. It's a way for fans to help pull together known bugs in one place. 

- If bugs are listed in CTs and Patch release notes as fixed, I will try to close issues with links to the release nodes
- If devs want to contribute and close bugs, after verification, I will gladly give them the ability to close bugs in the repo. 
- This is not meant to make money or in any way disparage the devs or the game, this is just to allow us fans to know what is reported and not reported, and help to provide a concise list to anyone who may want to fix bugs.
